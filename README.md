# CrowdFunding_DB
## Independent Funding, a client company, needed help moving their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. 

## I assisted a data analysis with the following:
- Extracting and transforming the data from the large Excel file into four separate CSV files
- Creating a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD
- Loading the CSV files into the database
- Performing SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders

## With this proect complete, the analytics team will be able to perform analysis and create reports for company stakeholders as well as individuals who donate to projects.
